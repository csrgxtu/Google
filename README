Google is not the real Google, it is just a practice project that try to
implement a system a little like Google, and along this way, I hope that
we will learn a lot from it.
Google is a project combine practice with theory, that is the most
beautiful part of this project.
This project should all be implemented with native Linux programming language, i mean only these languages will be chosen, C, C++, Python, Perl, PHP.
Don't not use Java implement any part of my system, for Java is the wrong choice in efficiency.
