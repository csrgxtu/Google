Google is not the real Google, it is just a practice project that try to
implement a system a little like Google, and along this way, I hope that
we will learn a lot from it.
Google is a project combine practice with theory, that is the most
beautiful part of this project.
This project should all be implemented with native Linux programming language, i mean only these languages will be chosen, C, C++, Python, Perl, PHP.
Don't not use Java implement any part of my system, for Java is the wrong choice in efficiency.

there are something i want to make it clear, my ultimite goal is to
build a search engine system a little like Google. for these days,
i have read some books, seen something, it is pretty inspiring. and
in the declaration of 10/Jan/2014, I want to use none Java language
to implement the system, now, here I change this princple, for me,
it is not likely workable to just use C++ to do the work, for
example, I can't find a solution to parse the html document using
C++ until now. and since, there a plenty of books and resource
I can use when using Java implement the system.
In a word, I am gonna use Java in my system to boots up the
development speed.
